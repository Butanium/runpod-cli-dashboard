- starts a pod with a A40 with private template l1usydkydn
- connect to ssh to the pod and run a command (and capture the output in the background, make it go into the terminal output)
- get the public ip of the pod
- open the page exposed by the pod on port 8501 in the browser


all of this should be done in a single python script and all the constants should be in a default hydra config file.
